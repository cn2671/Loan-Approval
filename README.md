Financial Risk for Loan Approval: COMS-W4995 Applied Machine Learning Project

This ZIP consists of:
	- README file, 
	- .ipynb file
	- Loan.csv (Kaggle dataset)

The dataset used can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzozoppelletto/financial-risk-for-loan-approval. Make sure it is in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook so all the code will run.

The .ipynb file tests many classification and regression models on the data to predict loan approval and risk score (our two target variables). 

You can run the notebook and read the project report, which summarizes and analyzes our findings. Please make sure to install all packages imported in our notebook for the code to run successfully.

In the code sample, i have contributed on the data preprocessing part.
